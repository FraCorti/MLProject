\section{Abstract}
The aim of the following document is to illustrate the work done for the Machine Learning course project. We created a library to build neural network in C++ exploit Armadillo numerical library. We built models with one and more hidden layer, we implemented cross-validation using k-fold technique and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The implementation was designed to be modular and extensible.
