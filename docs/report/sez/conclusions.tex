\section{Conclusions}
The project made us understand how the theory seen during the course was strictly correlated with the implementation of a real neural network library. Thanks to the MONK's dataset we discovered how really the regularization techniques prevents overfitting controlling model complexity. We understood the importance of choosing a good model and how to do it using grid search and k-cross validation. The hyper-parameter tuning was also the most difficult phase with the debugging and testing of the backpropagation algorithm. This experience thought to us the foundations of learning algorithms on neural network on which many machine learning frameworks are based today. The experience of working in a team has allowed us to refine our knowledge about how a really work experience is done and helped us not to break down during development.
