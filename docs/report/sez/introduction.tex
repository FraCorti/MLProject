\section{Introduction}
Our goal is to create a Neural Network model simulator and apply it to MONK's classification problems and the ML CUP regression problem. 
We developed a library with the aim of build, training and test feedforward neural networks using back-propagation and multiple version of gradient descent: stochastic/online, mini-batch and batch with Nesterov Momentum and weight decay as regularization and using various activation functions and loss functions. 
Our assumption was to find the best model for each problem, this has been reached by looking for a smooth  and compact loss function. This aim has been pursued using grid search technique with k-fold cross validation. We paid attention not to commit overfitting using regularization technique such as weight decay.
